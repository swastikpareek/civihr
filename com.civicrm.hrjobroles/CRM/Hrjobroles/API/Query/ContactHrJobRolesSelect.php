 * set of properties, and also include the id of the contact the role belongs to,
 * which is an information that is not stored together with the Job Role. It does
 * this by creating a query that joins the Job Roles table with the Contract
 * table, where the contact ID exists.
 *
 * Internally it uses a child class of the Api3SelectQuery class, which means
 * it can support everything that a normal .get query can like:
 * - Different operators (IN, LIKE, <>, etc)
 * - Limit and Offset operations
 * - Sorting
